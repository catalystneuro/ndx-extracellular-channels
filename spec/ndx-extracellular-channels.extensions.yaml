    doc: The axes defining the contact plane for each contact. It can be used for
      contact-wise rotations. For 2D probes, provide two points (v1x, v1y) and (v2x,
      v2y). Axis 1 is defined by the vector from (0, 0) to (v1x, v1y). Axis 2 is defined
      by the vector from (0, 0) to (v2x, v2y). So for one contact, a 45 degree rotation
      would be [[1 / sqrt(2), 1 / sqrt(2)], [-1 / sqrt(2), 1 / sqrt(2)]]. The default
      is [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. For 3D probes, provide two points (v1x, v1y, v1z), (v2x,
